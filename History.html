                <p>
                    The town of Manorhamilton was built by Sir Frederick Hamilton and it was here between 1634 and 1638 that he built Manorhamilton Castle, his fortified house that gives the town its name. It is seen as one of a group of six in Ireland which feature defensive flanking towers at each corner.
                    The castle withstood attacks in 1641 during the Irish rebellion, but was later taken and burned by the Earl of Clanrickard in 1652 during the War of the Three Kingdoms.
                    A permanent exhibition is on display at Manorhamilton Castle Heritage Centre, including artifacts from the 17th century, replica period costumes, furniture, a castle model and other interesting items and information which allow you to peek through the centuries to what life was like when the castle was in use.
                    Manorhamilton Castle and Heritage Centre is open year-round to the general public and to organised tours. A tour of the recently restored castle ruins and grounds can be taken, conducted by an experienced and informative guide.
                    The Manorhamilton Heritage Trail guides you through the rich heritage and history of the town.

                    Nestling at center of the North Letrim Glens sits Manorhamilton, a town rich in history, heritage and architecture and surrounded by the unspoiled beauty of lovely Letrim.
                    On an elevated site overlooking the town stands Hamiltion's Castle. 
                    This is now the only visable reminder of the Scottish Nobelman,Sir Frederick Hamiltion, who in the 1622 Plantation of Letrim by King James 1 was granted 6500 acres of land in this area stamped his name on this town.
                    Within five years of the building of the Castle in 1634-1636, the nucleus of the town was estabilshed consiting of 20-25 stone houses, at least one inn , two cornmills, a Protestant Church and a population of 100.
                    Since that time trial of built heritage can traced, each century adding futhur treasures.
                    Our heritage has been gifted to us from the past and comes with a duty of conservation and a commitment to pass it safely on to future generations.
                    We wish all those who use the Manorhamiltion Heritage Trial the pleasure of enjoyment in the richness of our past.
